/**

 * <p>Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no
 * 			running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively
 * 			maintaining tasks, you can't delete it, and you must update the service to a desired
 * 			task count of zero. For more information, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup,
 * 				the service status moves from <code>ACTIVE</code> to <code>DRAINING</code>, and the
 * 				service is no longer visible in the console or in the <a>ListServices</a>
 * 				API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either <code>STOPPING</code> or
 * 					<code>STOPPED</code> status, the service status moves from <code>DRAINING</code>
 * 				to <code>INACTIVE</code>. Services in the <code>DRAINING</code> or
 * 					<code>INACTIVE</code> status can still be viewed with the <a>DescribeServices</a> API operation. However, in the future,
 * 					<code>INACTIVE</code> services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record
 * 				keeping, and <a>DescribeServices</a> calls on those services return a
 * 					<code>ServiceNotFoundException</code> error.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service
 * 				in either <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>DRAINING</code> status, you receive an
 * 				error.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ECSClient, DeleteServiceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ecs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ECSClient, DeleteServiceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ecs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ECSClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteServiceRequest
 *   cluster: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   service: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   force: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteServiceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteServiceCommandInput - {@link DeleteServiceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteServiceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteServiceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteServiceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ECSClientResolvedConfig | config} for ECSClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ClientException} (client fault)
 *  <p>These errors are usually caused by a client action. This client action might be using
 * 			an action or resource on behalf of a user that doesn't have permissions to use the
 * 			action or resource,. Or, it might be specifying an identifier that isn't valid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ClusterNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified cluster wasn't found. You can view your available clusters with <a>ListClusters</a>. Amazon ECS clusters are Region specific.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified parameter isn't valid. Review the available parameters for the API
 * 			request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>These errors are usually caused by a server issue.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified service wasn't found. You can view your available services with <a>ListServices</a>. Amazon ECS services are cluster specific and Region
 * 			specific.</p>
 *
 *
 * @example To delete a service
 * ```javascript
 * // This example deletes the my-http-service service. The service must have a desired count and running count of 0 before you can delete it.
 * const input = {
 *   "service": "my-http-service"
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteServiceCommand(input);
 * await client.send(command);
 * // example id: e8183e38-f86e-4390-b811-f74f30a6007d
